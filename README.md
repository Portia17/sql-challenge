## Module 9 Challenge
All necessary code and data is in EmployeeSQL: https://github.com/Portia17/sql-challenge/tree/main/EmployeeSQL <br /> 

Inside this folder, the image I took of my ERD can be found: https://github.com/Portia17/sql-challenge/blob/main/EmployeeSQL/ERD.png <br /> 

The Analyses folder within the EmployeeSQL folder contains the tables created from the queries: https://github.com/Portia17/sql-challenge/tree/main/EmployeeSQL/Analyses <br /> 

The Code folder within the EmployeeSQL folder contains the table_code file for how I created my tables exported from QuickDBD and the queries file contains the list of queries. <br />
